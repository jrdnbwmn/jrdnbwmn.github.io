            <h2 class="mb2">Hey there.</h2>
            <p>My name's Jordan Bowman. I'm a product manager for niche tech company called <a href="https://www.catylist.com/index.jsp" class="link">Catylist</a>. Before that, I was a designer and developer. I make stuff online like <a href="https://www.eatapapaya.com/" class="link">Papaya</a>, send out a <a href="/newsletter/" class="link">weekly newsletter</a> called Query, and do some <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jrdnbwmn" class="link">tweeting</a>. My family and I live in&nbsp;Denver.</p>
            <p>The site is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="link">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="link">GitHub Pages</a>. It's all custom-built, with my front-end boilerplate <a href="https://www.eatapear.com/" class="link">Pear</a> as a starting point.</p>
