            <h2 class="mb2">Hey there, I'm Jordan.</h2>
            <p>I'm a product manager for niche tech company called <a href="https://www.catylist.com/index.jsp" class="link">Catylist</a>. Before that, I was a designer and developer. I've made a few things online, too, like <a href="https://www.eatapapaya.com/" class="link">Papaya</a> and <a href="https://www.eatapear.com/" class="link">Pear</a>. I send out a <a href="/newsletter/" class="link">weekly newsletter</a> called Query and do some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitter.com/jrdnbwmn" class="link">tweeting</a>.</p>
            <p>I like riding my bike, swimming, and reading when I get a chance. I have a beautiful wife and four awesome kids. We live in Denver. I love my family more than my&nbsp;work.</p>
