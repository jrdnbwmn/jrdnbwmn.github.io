<hr class="hr hr-small mb2">

<p>This page is meant to showcase the patterns on this site (particularly the blog posts). It&#8217;s for my own benefit as designer and maintainer, but it&#8217;s also here to satisfy the curiosity of nerds like me who like this kind of stuff. You can see the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/jrdnbwmn.github.io">source</a>&nbsp;onÂ GitHub.</p>
<p>This site will never be &#8220;done.&#8221; I&#8217;ll be making continual improvements and updates to it. The typography is set in Calluna and Myriad Pro, served via Typekit. Particular attention was paid to providing an excellent reading experience. Now here come some excerpts from the book David&nbsp;Copperfield.</p>
<p>The first act of business Miss Murdstone performed when the day of the solemnity was over, and light was freely admitted into the house, was to give Peggotty a month&#8217;s warning. Much as Peggotty would have disliked such a service, I believe she would have retained it, for my sake, in preference to the best upon&nbsp;earth.</p>
<h3>Make Another&nbsp;Beginning</h3>
<p>As to me or my future, not a word was said, or a step taken. Happy they would have been, I dare say, if they could have dismissed me at a month&#8217;s warning too. I <a class="link" href="#">mustered courage</a> once, to ask Miss Murdstone when I was going back to school; and she answered dryly, she believed I was not going back at all. I was told nothing&nbsp;more. </p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>First bulleted&nbsp;item</li>
    <li>Yeah, here&#8217;s another&nbsp;one</li>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Oop and here&#8217;s a&nbsp;sublevel</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Then back to&nbsp;normal</li>
</ul>
<p>I was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me, and so was Peggotty; but neither she nor I could pick up any information on the&nbsp;subject.</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li>Here&#8217;s an ordered&nbsp;list</li>
    <li>One more item&nbsp;here</li>
    <li>Okay this is the last&nbsp;one</li>
    <li>Um I lied about&nbsp;that</li>
</ol>
<p>There was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of a great deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been capable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the&nbsp;future.</p>
<figure class="img-aside">

    <figcaption class="mt subSize">This is a left-aligned image and caption, set in the sans serif. I have no idea what place this is.</figcaption>

<p>By and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry, and the same result. At length, I got up whenever I saw him coming, and standing on the foot-board, pretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>At first I was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone&#8217;s devoting herself to it; but I soon began to think that such fears were groundless, and that all I had to anticipate was&nbsp;neglect.</p>
<p>I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then. I was still giddy with the shock of my mother&#8217;s death, and in a kind of stunned state as to all tributary&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>If anything, short of being in a different relation to every one about me, Peggotty excepted, could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time, it would have been this project of all&nbsp;others.</p>
<h4>Third Level&nbsp;Heading</h4>
<p>The idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces, shining welcome on me; of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning, when the bells were ringing, the stones dropping in the water, and the shadowy ships breaking through the mist; of roaming up and down with little Em&#8217;ly, telling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach; made a calm in my&nbsp;heart.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">And what do you mean to do, Peggotty? Do you mean to go and seek your fortune?</blockquote>
<p>It was ruffled next moment, to be sure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone&#8217;s giving her consent; but even that was set at rest soon, for she came out to take an evening grope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation, and Peggotty, with a boldness that amazed me, broached the topic on the&nbsp;spot.</p>
<hr class="hr hr-small" />

<p>I thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should induce her to withdraw her&nbsp;assent.</p>
<pre class="codeBlock"><span class="code-red">body</span> {
    <span class="code-purple">display</span>: <span class="code-green">block</span>;
    <span class="code-purple">color</span>: $red;

}</pre>
<p>Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course, since she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as <code class="inlineCode">great an access</code> of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents. However, the permission was given, and was never retracted; for when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to&nbsp;depart.</p>
<pre class="codeBlock"><span class="code-blue">&lt;p</span> <span class="code-red">class=</span><span class="code-green">&quot;paragraph&quot;</span><span class="code-blue">&gt;</span>The Disintegration Loops of William Basinski are a demonstration of time and decay within the domain of sound.<span class="code-blue">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

    <span class="code-blue">&lt;li&gt;</span>Here's an ordered list<span class="code-blue">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="code-blue">&lt;li&gt;</span>One more item here<span class="code-blue">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="code-blue">&lt;li&gt;</span>Okay this is the last one<span class="code-blue">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="code-blue">&lt;/ol&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty&#8217;s boxes. I had never known him to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out, which I thought had meaning in it, if meaning could ever be said to find its way into Mr. Barkis&#8217;s&nbsp;visage.</p>

    <figcaption class="mt">This is an example caption on a breakout image. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years, and where the two strong attachments of her life - for my mother and myself - had been formed. She had been walking in the churchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it with her handkerchief at her&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>So long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign of life whatever. He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure. But when she began to look about her, and to speak to me, he nodded his head and grinned several times. I have not the least notion at whom, or what he meant by&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>At each of these inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her, and gave her another nudge; so that at last we were all crowded together in the left-hand corner of the cart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear&nbsp;it.</p>
