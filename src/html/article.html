            <p>First, as oil rents dry up, authoritarian oil-dependent governments could collapse. Few will miss them, but their passing could cause social unrest and strife. That will lead to the second danger: the <a href="">fallout for investors</a> in oil assets. If action to limit global warming accelerates in coming years, $1trn of oil assets could be rendered obsolete. This would leave stockmarkets dangerously exposed.</p>

            <p>The tension is inescapable. On the one hand government policy should press forward with the transition as fast as it can. On the other, a rapid transition will cause upheaval.</p>

            <h3>A red flare silhouetted the jagged edge of a wing. My two natures had memory in common?</h3>

            <p>In Lagos, the island of Ikoyi, which was once a garden suburb for British colonial officers, is now a wealthy residential area lived in by oil executives and politicians, with a golf course. But if you want to live here, you must “bring your own infrastructure”, jokes Giles Omezi, a Nigerian architect. Every private home or apartment block has not only its own security guards and generator, but its own borehole and water treatment system too. Even street lighting and roads can be privately provided: a thriving business in Lagos is reclaiming land on which to build fancy gated communities. The biggest of them, Eko Atlantic, is being built by a Lebanese family business, and stretches way out into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

            <p>Less than 1/4 of your audience will ever see your less-than-perfect Instagram post, thanks to the algorithm. And of that 1/4 that does see it, the ones that don’t like it will just keep scrolling. The people who love your work may not even sign in that day. The reality is, nothing actually matters that much, and I think I’ve felt that for a long time. </p>

            <p>Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Quasi ego id curem, quid ille aiat aut neget. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Sed fac ista esse non inportuna; </p>

            <p>Inquit, dasne adolescenti veniam? Simus igitur contenti his. Id <i>[redacted]</i>tilius factum negabat. </p>

            <p>Restinguet citius, si ardentem acceperit. Bestiarum vero nullum iudicium puto. Is es profecto tu. Rhetorice igitur, inquam, nos mavis quam dialectice disputare? Quibus ego vehementer assentior. </p>

            <p>Ita prorsus, inquam; Est enim effectrix multarum et magnarum voluptatum. Tanta vis admonitionis inest in locis; Obsecro, inquit, Torquate, haec dicit Epicurus? </p>

            <p>Invidiosum nomen est, infame, suspectum. Istic sum, inquit. Bonum liberi: misera orbitas. Ut pulsi recurrant? Tum Torquatus: Prorsus, inquit, assentior; Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. </p>

            <p>Sint ista Graecorum; Nemo nostrum istius generis asotos iucunde putat vivere. Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Confecta res esset. Perge porro; Conferam tecum, quam cuique verso rem subicias; Sin aliud quid voles, postea. Compensabatur, inquit, cum summis doloribus laetitia. </p>

            <p>Igitur ne dolorem quidem. Si longus, levis; Ita prorsus, inquam; Maximus dolor, inquit, brevis est. </p>
