&lt;p&gt;Look at this list of some of the most popular websites on the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craigslist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reddit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hacker News&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drudge Report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sites have little to no aesthetic appeal, but collectively they are visited by tens of millions people every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ask myself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we just showing off our design skills to other designers? Does the average consumer notice? Do aesthetics have a direct impact on revenue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are questions worth answering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-aesthetics-dont-matter&quot;&gt;“No, Aesthetics Don’t Matter!”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some would point to the above examples (and more) to make the case that beauty is irrelevant. They’d say visual design is mostly un-measurable mushy marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, software is a tool. We use it to accomplish tasks like communicating, writing, checking off a to-do, or socializing with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Giving the user the ability to perform a unique task is far more important than making it look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We jump on Wikipedia because it’s easy to get free encyclopedic information. We pull up Craigslist because we want to buy or sell something locally without having to pay for it. We visit Reddit for its distinctive take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter that these sites are ugly because they’re the best tools for their specific job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, part of the popularity of these sites has become their ugliness. It’s as if the user base is saying, “We just laugh at how ugly Reddit/Drudge Report/Hacker News is because we get quite a lot of utility from it, and that’s what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t build a valueless product, throw some eye-appeal on it, and expect it to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a rain poncho. This is an incredibly ugly piece of clothing. But millions of them are sold every year because they’re really good at their job — keeping you dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yes-aesthetics-do-matter&quot;&gt;“Yes, Aesthetics Do Matter!”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others say beauty is critically important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*WdoGi5bDzqndB3pRGsKkrQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;stripe.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies trying to build or sustain a brand, visual design matters because it’s part of the package. People recognize Stripe, for example, in part because of their stand-out aesthetics. Paul Rand said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something beautiful is also pleasing to use. And pleased customers keep coming back. It’s a piece (however small) of user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something is beautiful, you can feel that there was some thought put into its creation. That makes it feel professional and gives it an air of having been built on purpose — a feeling that whoever created this thought about you, the user, as they made it. When the opposite is true, it feels like someone just hacked it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those sites mentioned above — Craigslist, Reddit, etc. — those are the exception. They’re popular in spite of being ugly because they were first to market and have an entrenched user base. For those of us building something new, there’s no reason to purposefully forgo aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back a decade ago to when the very first iPhone came out. The usability and utility were there in abundance, to be sure. But people were also astounded by how beautiful it was. No other phone looked like that. Many people were (and still are) willing to pay an astronomical price for it, in large part because of that beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-takeaways&quot;&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which side are you on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s black and white. It’s a matter of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Form follows function.” Function certainly comes first, but that doesn’t mean form is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the priority goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utility&lt;/strong&gt;. Does your software help the consumer perform a unique task in a distinctive way? If it doesn’t, the heart of your software is missing and it will eventually die. Who wants a tool that doesn’t help you accomplish something?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you get out of their way so they can execute that task easily and intuitively? Is it reliable, speedy, organized?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;. Is it attractive in a way that contributes to utility and usability?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, add beauty. Beauty is wonderful. But utility and usability come first because that’s why people are there in the first place. Build around the purpose, then add aesthetics on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your user will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jrdnbwmn</name></author><category term="product" /><summary type="html">As a product designer, sometimes I question how important beauty is when it comes to software.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cryptic Startup Terms</title><link href="https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/cryptic-startup-terms/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cryptic Startup Terms" /><published>2018-01-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-01-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/cryptic-startup-terms</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/cryptic-startup-terms/">&lt;p&gt;The startup world throws around a lot of jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it is fluff, some of it is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than pretend like you know what people are talking about, I’ve found it’s good to make sure I actually understand the terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a few essential startup terms you should know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kpi&quot;&gt;KPI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Key Performance Indicator. This is a measurable value that indicates how effectively your company or product is achieving its business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I would guess a main KPI of AirBnB is &lt;strong&gt;guests per night&lt;/strong&gt; (how many people are staying on an AirBnB property on any given night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you can focus on improving key indicators, which should then directly influence your company’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;churn-rate&quot;&gt;Churn Rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your churn rate is the percentage of customers who stop subscribing to your service in a given time period. You can calculate the churn of anything (like revenue or employees), but it’s most often referring to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is considered the main enemy of any subscription company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: As of this writing, Buffer’s monthly user churn is &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.baremetrics.com/stats/user-churn&quot;&gt;5.9%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your acceptable churn rate depends entirely on your specific industry and company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;okr&quot;&gt;OKR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Objectives &amp;amp; Key Results. This is a framework for setting, communicating, and monitoring goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives are goals, which tell you where to go. Each objective has key results, which indicate how you’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: Increase our recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Results&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Share of monthly subscriptions increased to 85%.
Average subscription size of at least $295 per month.
Reduce churn to less than 1% per month.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://okrexamples.co/&quot;&gt;More examples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mrr&quot;&gt;MRR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Monthly Recurring Revenue. This is income that a company an reliably anticipate every 30 days. MRR is intended for products or services that have a defined price and recurring term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: As of this writing, Treehouse’s MRR is &lt;a href=&quot;https://getlatka.com/companies/treehouse&quot;&gt;$2M+&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put two terms together, your MRR churn is the erosion of your monthly recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue, not to be confused with Annual Run Rate (below) which even uses MRR in its calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usp&quot;&gt;USP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Unique Selling Proposition. This refers to the unique factor of your company or product that sets you apart from all your competition. It’s the answer to the question, “Why should I do business with you instead of anyone else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: M&amp;amp;M’s “Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.” M&amp;amp;Ms use a patented hard sugar coating that keep chocolate from melting in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arr&quot;&gt;ARR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Annual Run Rate. This is a method used to project future revenue based on your current revenue. To get it, simply multiply your MRR by 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that might seem inaccurate, ARR is a helpful tool to get an idea of long term growth and visualize the size of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: If a company’s MRR for last month was $100k, its current ARR $1.2M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burn-rate&quot;&gt;Burn rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your burn rate is the rate at which your company spends money in excess of income. It’s a measure of negative cash flow. It is usually quoted in terms of cash spent (lost) per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burn rate a good measuring stick for a company’s runway — the amount of time it has before it runs out of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: If a company has $1 million in the bank, makes $100k per month, and spends $200k per month, it has a burn rate of $100,000/month. It also has a runway of 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jrdnbwmn</name></author><category term="terminology" /><summary type="html">The startup world throws around a lot of jargon.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Legacy of AIM</title><link href="https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/the-legacy-of-aim/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Legacy of AIM" /><published>2017-12-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-12-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/the-legacy-of-aim</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jrdnbwmn.com/post/the-legacy-of-aim/">&lt;p&gt;On a cold February morning in 1997, America Online filed a patent for something that was to become the basis of hundreds of social tech startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They called it the “Buddy List.” It was the heart of the digital social structure that formed AOL Instant Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first words of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Query=PN%2F6750881&amp;amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;Sect2=PTO1&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; abstract explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The invention implements a real time notification system that tracks, for each user, the logon status of selected co-users of an on-line or network system and displays that information in real time to the tracking user in a unique graphical interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a 90’s kid, chances are you remember what a Buddy List was. You likely recall the AIM install CD, your screen name, and how much effort went into your carefully crafted away messages. You can probably reminisce about competing for time on the home computer so you could chat with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world had never seen anything like it. And it captivated us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, AOL Instant Messenger is shutting down for good, 20 years after it launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what it established lives on. AOL didn’t know it back then, and we don’t realize it today, but AIM is the father of our modern social web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe me? Let’s start with the Buddy List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buddy-list&quot;&gt;Buddy List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about what’s at the foundation of any social media you use today. It’s that list of other human beings. Followers, friends, whatever they’re called. Social media doesn’t work without these groups of real people and it all originated with the Buddy List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddy List was exactly what you’d think — your list of friends. You controlled who was on it. You could find new people through information they put in their profile, but you had to both agree to the connection — if you were on their buddy list, they were on yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important feature of the buddy list was the ability to see whether each person was online. This remarkable little feature created a way to “feel” that your friends were around. There was an intimacy and immediacy to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on someone’s buddy list meant something. Nothing had ever come along like this before AIM, where you had a digital group of connections tied to your real relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;away-messages&quot;&gt;Away Messages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one of your friends wasn’t online, you’d see their “away message.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever written a tweet or status update? Then you’ve gone through the same process AIM users went through to write away messages. It is the ancestor of those widely-used features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The away message started as a set of three default options: online, busy, or away. But then AOL set up the ability to write a custom message and it quickly transformed into a way to express yourself to your buddies. From simple plans you had for the day, to quoting lyrics from your favorite songs, the away message let you broadcast anything to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;profiles&quot;&gt;Profiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern digital profile is quite a remarkable thing. In essence, it represents the notion that we can have a web persona that we completely control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all agonized over the perfect profile pic or handle. We make conscious decisions about cover images and bios so that we present to the world exactly the image that we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all started on AIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service let you choose things like an avatar, bio, fonts, and colors, but your biggest decision was your screen name. It could be anything from xXPunkRockPonyXx to InternetDiane. The possibilities of every alphanumeric combination allowed you to choose something meaningful, personal, and easily recognizable, so that’s what everyone did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of customization helped us realize how what an online persona could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;messaging&quot;&gt;Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online instant messaging hit a sweet spot. It was better than email and less formal than a phone call. It fit right in with what the rising generation wanted as a form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still something we can’t get enough of 20 years later. The underlying concepts of Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, and Snapchat all began with AIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where communication and real human connection actually happened. Things like late night chats with your best friend about the latest music or deliberately worded conversations with that girl or boy you had a crush on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all about the contact with other human beings over the internet in a real, direct, private, and personal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-running-man&quot;&gt;The Running Man&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIM could be considered the first social media superpower. It was a digital consumer tool used at an unprecedented scale, a household name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It defined the social potential of the web for Americans. Perhaps more than any other product, AIM helped establish the internet as a place to hang out rather than a simple utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs realized that, too. AIM was the starting point of an exponential trend in social web startups. Companies like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram are some of the major players who have ridden that wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The running yellow figure of AIM’s logo seems fitting in retrospect. The idea of always on, always transmitting captured the feeling quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the runner is passing the baton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had just arrived in San Francisco that summer, so he jumped online in hopes of finding a recommendation for a doctor. Instead, all Stoppelman found were bare bones directories and useless information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this gave him an idea. He and Russel Simmons were in San Francisco working for a business incubator called MRL Ventures, searching for “the next big thing” on the internet. He met with Simmons over lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*cF41tRIYL_5tag6XjGFBRw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Early photo of the founders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two were in the office of their boss, Max Levchin, pitching their new concept before dinnertime. They didn’t have a PowerPoint presentation or a specific revenue plan; just a sense that they could make something that would appeal to lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levchin hesitated. “I wasn’t sure if it would work. But the guys were really enthusiastic about it. And in my experience, when you have smart people who work well together, it’s foolish not to invest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was feeling lucky because it was his 29th birthday, or maybe it was those tens of millions laying around from his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Max_Levchin#/PayPal&quot;&gt;exit from PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, but Levchin agreed. He invested $1 million in the half-baked idea and Stoppelman and Simmons got to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yelp-10&quot;&gt;Yelp 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what were they building? The two founders realized from Stoppelman’s doctor experience that the best way to find a business was through word of mouth. But word of mouth hadn’t moved to the web yet. The question they were asking was, “How do we bring those in-person recommendations online?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They thought the answer was email and that’s exactly what the earliest version of Yelp was. On the website Simmons put together, users could email their friends asking for recommendations on specific locations or types of places. Responses were logged on a communal site for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their first review came in on October 12, 2004. Katherine W. gave Truly Mediterranean four stars and a simple, but convincing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“dirt cheap, good falafels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that promising review, their idea was a flop. It attracted few users beyond the founders’ friends and family and failed to impress the venture capital investors whom Stoppelman pitched at the end of 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We got the doors slammed in our face over and over again,” Stoppelman said. Things were starting to fizzle right before their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-epiphany&quot;&gt;The Epiphany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, the founders searched for a way to improve their product. One day, they noticed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site had a link, buried somewhere in the footer, that you could click if you wanted to submit a review without being asked. While poring over their analytics, they realized that people were not only finding that link, they were beginning to use it — often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They watched as users submitted unsolicited reviews more and more. It got even bigger than the email-requested reviews. People would write 5, 10, or 15 reviews in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They knew they had stumbled upon something big. So in February 2005, the duo launched a brand new site, this time focused entirely on unsolicited reviews. Yelp 2.0 saw an immediate rise in traffic. It was a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-foundation&quot;&gt;The Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick-start the process of building a platform for this new review system, they purchased a database of over 20 million business locations. This database was old and inaccurate, but it created the framework for what Yelp called “claimed business locations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empty business pages functioned as an open invitation for people to submit reviews. It motivated people to, at the very least, write a few words about the business. In fact, many of the early reviews were just that: “this place is great”, or “this place sucked.” But as time passed, reviewers started to take the platform more seriously and write longer, deeper reviews. The framework paid off in dividends later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, they didn’t subordinate the user’s contributions to professional reviews, as on Citysearch, or to directory information, like yellow-pages sites. Instead, Yelp motivated people to share reviews through praise and attention , something no one else was doing. Those social networking features were what made them stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-social&quot;&gt;Getting Social&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that they had the right direction, they needed to grow their user base. Without the cash for a national rollout, Stoppelman decided to first focus on making Yelp famous locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a buzz-marketing guru he hired on a whim, Stoppelman decided to select a few dozen people — the most active reviewers on the site — and throw them an open-bar party. As a joke, he called the group the Yelp Elite Squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tw43stnSQV1ogeMWQxjmsw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A Yelp Elite Event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levchin thought the idea was crazy: “I was like, ‘Holy crap, we’re nowhere near profitability; this is ridiculous,’ “. But 100 people showed up to the first party, and traffic to the site began to increase. Since the parties were reserved for prolific reviewers, they gave casual users a reason to use the site more and nonusers a reason to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By June 2005, Yelp had 12,000 reviewers, most of them in the Bay Area. In November, Stoppelman went back to the VCs and bagged $5 million from Bessemer Venture Partners. He used the money to throw more parties and hire party planners — Yelp called them “community managers” — in New York, Chicago, and Boston. Community managers and the Yelp Elite Squad still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stickers&quot;&gt;Stickers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of reviewers on the site grew to 100,000 by 2006. Stoppelman also raised several million more in venture capital. By summer 2006, Yelp had one million monthly visitors and they were slowly adding more cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that user counts were growing, they focused on their next problem: they needed to get merchants to play a much deeper role. A growing user base of reviewers was wonderful, but the other side of the coin was the businesses themselves. Not to mention they were Yelp’s only source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decided to begin an aggressive drive to get merchants to claim business listings, populate them (e.g. menus, hours, website, etc), and motivate their own customers to review their experiences on Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*stZmCHgt2FOrspxGZIMLVg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The Yelp Sticker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yelp continued to grow. The service kept adding cities and eventually went international. They launched a successful mobile app. Stoppelman gathered tens of millions in venture capital and then took it IPO. As of this writing, the company has a market cap of almost &lt;a href=&quot;quotes.wsj.com/YELP&quot;&gt;$3.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve made a few mistakes along the way, and some say they’re in the middle of a process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation&quot;&gt;disruption&lt;/a&gt;. But Yelp — the original king of place reviews — spawned a score of apps and startups and changed the way consumers view their relationship with businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, they get…&lt;/p&gt;
